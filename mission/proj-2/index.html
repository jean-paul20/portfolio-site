<p>Since the late 70’s this <strong>Industrial holding</strong> (Income 890M€, 3100 employees) operated its French business thru an <strong>in-house ERP</strong> named <strong>Glink</strong>. It was used by 7 legal companies in 4 businesses thru about 500 named users.

<p>The scope of this in-house solution included sales, production, warehousing, procurement, payroll, accounting. For instance, the sales income went up to 300M€. Technically speaking, its architecture was two-tier based : server on BULL DPS7000 mainframe and application in Cobol while client application on Microsoft VB6.</p>

<p>In 2008, its unique chief architect and key developer was to <em>retire soon</em>.</p>

<p>After a quick technical audit, Jean-Paul had the data moved under central MS SQL server databases and the <strong>last French BULL DSP7000</strong> eventually decommissioned.</p>

<p>Jean-Paul hired a qualified developer while agreeing upon a short term prolongation with the new retiree. The <strong>Management committee</strong> decided to formalize and follow the business improvement requests thru a <strong>roadmap</strong> based on the expected benefits. The former <strong>Glink</strong> turned into a windows based <strong>LaSuite</strong> set of business applications.</p>
