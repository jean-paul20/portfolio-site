<p>In 2014, the new managing committee of the Industrial holding decides to move all the French companies from the in-house ERP to ERPâ€™s of the market.
During the time of project (at least two years), the current solution was to be outsourced and all changes or upgrades were frozen.</p>

<p>There were two layers of the systems to outsource :
* the support of the home made business application, looking for an offer called TMA
* the infrastructure the solution was running upon, looking for both hosting and facility management.</p>

<p>Among the several tenders received,
we selected Euriware as the supplier of the TMA service,</p>

<p>and a partnership between Orange and GFI for the outsourced infrastructure.</p>

<p>Jean-Paul, with his background of solutions and skills made it possible to smoothly and quickly outsource the I.S solution of such a large scope.</p>
