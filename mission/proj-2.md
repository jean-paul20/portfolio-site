The scope of this in-house solution included sales, production, warehousing, procurement, payroll, accounting. For instance, the sales income went up to 300M€. Technically speaking, its architecture was two-tier based : server on BULL DPS7000 mainframe and application in Cobol while client application on Microsoft VB6.

In 2008, its unique chief architect and key developer was to *retire soon*.

Jean-Paul hired a qualified developer while agreeing upon a short term prolongation with the new retiree. The **Management committee** decided to formalize and follow the business improvement requests thru a **roadmap** based on the expected benefits. The former __Glink__ turned into a windows based __LaSuite__ set of business applications.
