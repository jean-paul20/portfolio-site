In 2011, a major private equity firm took majority stake in the Industrial holding company. A few months after, a value creation plan started
to optimize the financial resources of this previously family owned group.
In its early stages the plan was driven by the Bain & Company consultancy firm.

Jean-Paul's mission was to coordinate the local I.T team's effort to provide :  
* accurate data for the initial analysis
* automated adjustments of local ERP's settings to match the current needs.

For instance, the minimal inventory levels in French stock locations were to be adjusted monthly for each item. As this time, this French unit operated a bespoke application, the new requirements were coded into the software.

In the countries already using SAP, a quick change of settings solved the issue.


Another WCR improvement channel was to send out Account Receivable's due invoices to factoring companies. It also involved deeply I.T not only to provide AR ledger but also keep track of the factored balance in banks accounts.
