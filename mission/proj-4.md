One reason was that the production department couldn't easily plan nor monitor the scheduled orders. After selecting and testing 3 solutions from leaders of the **APS** market, the Business went for Ortems as their orders and resources scheduling solution.

The project was two folds:
* the business had to learn modern APS technics around Ortems
* I.T has to integrate the chosen APS into the legacy in-house ERP **LaSuite**.

Within a 6 months timeframe, Jean-Paul had a set of two-ways **interfaces** developed, tested and implemented around customer, procurement, manufacturing and stock orders. The Ortems software, hardware and external consultancy cost about 100kâ‚¬.

**About 30%** of the root reason for our delays were therefore addressed.
