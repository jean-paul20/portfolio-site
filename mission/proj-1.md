In 1998 this Swedish group (Income 345M€, 2000 employees) leader in the **Rolls Industry** acquired 5 plants located in France and Belgium.

Part of the merging process, the **Information System** was renewed to become the  one single corporate solution. At that time Jean-Paul was the I.T manager in charge of France and Belgium affiliates.

Up to 2002 he led a **team of 50 co-workers** implementing the **ERP Lawson M3** and making it an efficient business solution. The team was mainly composed by key-users and a few IT technicians.

After two years, about 85% of the initial scope was delivered within a 3 M€ budget.
Everyone agreed to call it success.
